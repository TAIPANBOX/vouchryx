// Package dpop verifies the sender-constraint proof of RFC 9449.
//
// # What the proof is for
//
// A bearer token is a bearer token: anybody holding the bytes may use them. A
// delegation token that says "this agent may act for that person" is exactly the
// kind of bytes worth stealing, and every enforcement point in this estate would
// honour a stolen one. DPoP binds an issued token to a key the holder proves
// possession of, so the bytes alone are not enough.
//
// The proof is a small JWS the client signs per request, carrying its public key
// in the header. This package verifies that proof and returns the RFC 7638
// thumbprint of the key, which the issuer then puts in `cnf.jkt` on the token it
// issues. An enforcement point later compares the thumbprint on the token with
// the thumbprint of the key that signed the proof in front of it.
//
// # What it refuses, and why each one is not paranoia
//
//   - **A proof whose header carries no `jwk`.** There is nothing to bind to.
//   - **A proof signed by a key other than the one in its header.** Otherwise
//     anybody can staple somebody else's public key to their own proof and be
//     issued a token bound to a key they do not hold.
//   - **A private member in the embedded `jwk`.** RFC 9449 requires the public
//     key. A `d` there is a client leaking its own signing key to us, and
//     accepting it makes this service a place private keys collect.
//   - **`htm` or `htu` that do not match the request in front of us.** A proof
//     is for ONE request. Without this, a proof captured from a call to a
//     harmless endpoint is replayed against this one.
//   - **An `iat` outside the window.** A proof with no freshness is a bearer
//     token wearing a proof's clothes.
//   - **A `jti` already seen inside that window.** The window bounds a replay;
//     this closes it.
